## TF2 Interface focused on a fully optimization of the game.

After many tweaks and edits I made for make this a "perfect" hud, I decided to make it like the default one.
This HUD is focused ENTIRELY on optimize the game, but there are some personal changes I made.

Those changes are located inside "_jofrenew" folder. Which probably will be disabled by default.

However, there are other changes that can be emulated as the orginal hud like the item effect metter.
