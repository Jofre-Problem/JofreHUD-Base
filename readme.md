## TF2 Interface focused on a fully optimization of the game.

After many tweaks and edits I made for make this a "perfect" hud, I decided to make it like the default one.
This HUD is focused ENTIRELY on optimize the game, but there are some personal changes I made.

Those changes are located inside "_jofrenew" folder. Which probably will be disabled by default.

However, there are other changes that CANT be emulated as the orginal hud like the item effect metter.

This is pretty much my base for future HUDS. You can grab all the optimization stuff I did here for actually added it to your own hud.

But please, give credit.

# Compatibility with other huds

Well, I have tested and there is no way to make this hud work with another. Even if all the files are stored on "_jofrenew", aparrently only reads the clientscheme & gamemenu files, but not the /ui/ ones.

This is a huge problem for me in order to testing. The only soluton (which is bad) I found is about link "_jofrenew" inside the "jofrehud" folder.
