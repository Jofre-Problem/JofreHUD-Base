## TF2 Interface focused on a fully optimization of the game.

After many tweaks and edits I made for make this a "perfect" hud, I decided to make it like the default one.
This HUD is focused ENTIRELY on optimize the game, but there are some personal changes I made.
Those changes are located inside "_jofrenew" folder. Which probably will be disabled by default.
This is pretty much my base for future HUDS. You can grab all the optimization stuff I did here for actually added it to your own hud.
But please, give credit.

NOTE: After all the attention that come with this project being published, im aware of the lack of information of the readme and no changelog, sorry about that.

## HUD Structure
Before starting, this HUD files are from:
- tf2_misc_dir

This being documented on "gameinfo.txt"

Which has contains the following folders:(A - Z)
- addons (platform)
- admin (platform)
- demo (platform)
- cfg (custom .scr)
- demo (platform)
- dev (from basehud for HUD Updating)
- friends (platform)
- models (no use)
- resource (tf2 & hl2 & platform)
- scripts (tf2 & hl2)
- servers (platform)
- sound (fix for missing "vo/null.wav")
- _stream_ (grabbed from "budhud"; self explanatory)
- _tf2hud (default tf2 & hl2 & platform files)
- _jofrehud (basically all my work on this)
- _jofrehud/_tf2fix (files that I have fixed from the TF2 Files, ex: typos; wrong fieldnames; etc)

Now, these are the following HUD fixes that I came across:
